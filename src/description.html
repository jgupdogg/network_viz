    We have queried data to and from Coinbase on the Ethereum blockchain and joined existing ETH balances with all unknown and customer addresses.
    This visualization shows the flows to and from the 'hot wallet', where customers buy and receive crypto on Coinbase. The hot wallet and general
    contract are the busiest nodes in the network, as defined by their degree centrality.
